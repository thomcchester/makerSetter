#makerSetter

A useful script for making scripts based of previously made projects.

#About
It is a little difficult to describe what this app does. However anybody that needs to create many projects that remarkably similar or have created their own template might find this little app useful.

#how to use
working on that I am going to make a npm module that will make it much easier to use.

-set bin to $PATH or usr/local/bin
-chmod 755 makerSetter
